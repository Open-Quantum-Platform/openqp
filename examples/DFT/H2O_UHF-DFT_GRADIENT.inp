# DFT/6-31G*/BHHLYP/UHF/GRADIENT of H2O
# For Open-Shell systems we use UHF, when we use UHF, we have to choose multiplicity=3. 
# Since this is a DFT calculation, we have to set method=hf and to perform gradient calculation we 
# we have to set runtype=grad. Because this is a DFT calculation, we dont need [tdhf] section.
