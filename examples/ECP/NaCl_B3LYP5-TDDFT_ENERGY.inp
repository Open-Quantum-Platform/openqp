# TDDFT/6-31G*/B3LYP5/GRADIENT of H2O
# For Closed-Shell sytems calculation, we have to choose multiplicity=1 and [scf] type=rhf.
# Since this is a TDDFT calculation, we have to set method=tdhf and to perform gradient calculation we
# have to set runtype=grad. For gradient we have to set grad=3 in [properties] section.
# grad=1 in TDDFT is S1 while for SF and MRSF, it is S0. So with MRSF you can calculate
# S0 state gradient.
