# DFT/aug-cc-pVDZ-PP,aug-cc-pVDZ/BHHLYP/RHF/ENERGY of HBr
# Also, different basis sets can be used.
# For Closed-Shell systems we use RHF, when we use RHF, we have to choose multiplicity=1. 
# Since this is a DFT calculation, we have to set method=hf. Because DFT calculation, 
# we dont need [tdhf] section.
