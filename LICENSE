# Licensing Terms for Open Quantum Platform (OpenQP)

## Overview

The Open Quantum Platform (OpenQP) is distributed under an open-source license for academic and non-commercial use. To sustain its development, a dual licensing model has been adopted, allowing users to choose between a free open-source license or a commercial license for proprietary use. Revenue from commercial licenses directly supports the ongoing development of OpenQP.

OpenQP is offered under two distinct licensing options:

1. **Open Source License**: GNU General Public License v3 (GPLv3)
2. **Commercial License**: For proprietary use of OpenQP

Please review the sections below to determine which license applies to your use of OpenQP.

## 2. Commercial License

A commercial license allows for proprietary use of OpenQP without the obligation to distribute derivative works under the GPLv3. This is ideal for companies or individuals who wish to incorporate OpenQP into proprietary software.

If you intend to use OpenQP in a proprietary product or service and prefer not to distribute your derivative works under the GPLv3, you must obtain a commercial license.
